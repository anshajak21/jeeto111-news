Because in the past there are many such examples which have proved that love really knows no boundaries. Here in this article, we will specifically focus on some examples of cricket which proved that love really knows no boundaries. As everyone knows how India and Pakistan are arch rivals in politics and sports, but when it comes to love affair, there are cricketers from the Pakistani side who took an extra mile in choosing partners from India. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Check out below the list of Pakistani cricketers who found love among their Indian counterparts.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/taj777news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9482\" width=\"1008\" height=\"567\" srcset=\"https:\/\/taj777news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/taj777news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/taj777news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/taj777news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Shoaib Malik &amp; Sania Mirza<\/strong> \u2013 The well-known cricket star and the former captain of the Pakistani cricket team fell in love with Sania Mirza back in 2010, and decided to get married with one another. They have son named Izhaan Mirza Malik. Both individuals being a sports professional gets less time with each other and they travel a lot. So, in order to minimize such gaps, the two have bought a house in the middle i.e., Dubai, UAE to spend time together.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/taj777news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-3-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9485\" srcset=\"https:\/\/taj777news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-3-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/taj777news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-3-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/taj777news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-3-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/taj777news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-3.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p> 2. <strong>Zaheer Abbas &amp; Rita Lutra (Currently Samina Abbas) <\/strong>\u2013 The second in the list we have chosen to be is the veteran former cricket player Zaheer Abbas &amp; Rita Lutra. They fell in love during 1988 and decide to get married with each other. Zaheer Abbas was so famous in his time that he was even called the \u201cBradman of Asia\u201d. The interesting part is when Zaheer married Rita, he was already a married guy, but as said love has no boundaries, and the customs in the Muslim religion, allowed the two to get married with each other. Zaheer from his previous marriage has three daughters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/taj777news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-1-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9483\" width=\"1038\" height=\"584\" srcset=\"https:\/\/taj777news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/taj777news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-1-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/taj777news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-1-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/taj777news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-1.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1038px) 100vw, 1038px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Hasan Ali &amp; Samiya Arzoo <\/strong>\u2013 These both individual first met in Dubai. After dating for two years the two decided to tie knot with each other in 2019. Samiya who hails from the city of Faridabad, works with Emirates Airlines, and interestingly she was big fan of the player and has a common celebrity favourite as Virat Kohli. What then, with equal interest and values they decided to get married and have a beautiful girl child name, Helena Hasan Ali.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/taj777news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-2-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9484\" width=\"1043\" height=\"588\" srcset=\"https:\/\/taj777news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/taj777news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-2-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/taj777news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-2-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/taj777news.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-2.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1043px) 100vw, 1043px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>4. <strong>Mohsin Ali &amp; Reena Roy <\/strong>\u2013 The story of these two individuals compared to the above three will probably not be the one you must think about but will have end with something not very easy to go thing. The two met and fell in love in the late 80\u2019s. Reena Roy at that point was at her peak of career when she met Mohsin Ali, who was also playing well being associated with the Pakistani team but after few years of being together the two decided to get apart and experienced a divorce in 1990.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>So, these were some of the famous bonding\u2019s the cricketer from both the nation had and probably would continue in the coming future as well.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/taj777news.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Read more<\/a>: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/taj777news.com\/icc-odi-rankings-pakistan-overtake-india-to-take-4th-spot-after-3-0-sweep-of-west-indies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ICC ODI rankings: Pakistan overtake India to take 4th spot after 3-0 sweep of West Indies<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;Love knows no boundaries&#8221;, Andreja Pejic quote by Andreja Pejic sounds true.
