Is it possible to rate all soccer players? That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done here. The ability to single-handedly win games, longevity, and success under pressure were all considered. Consistency and real sportsmen spirit are also appreciated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Let&#8217;s look at these ten greatest footballers of all time.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1<strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pel%C3%A9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pele<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Pele is considered the greatest footballer of all time. No player has won more world championships than he has. This should be enough to bring him to the top. Pele was the top scorer for his club and country. He is the only player to score over 1200 senior goals. Pele played his best game when he counted the most. Pele played in the 1958 final against Sweden, aged 17 and in 249 days he scored twice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1970, he established himself as the greatest footballer of all time, although he missed his 1962 World Cup with an injury. Brazil outshined the tournament. Pele won the Golden Ball (Best Player) award in that event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2 Diego Maradona<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Diego Maradona&#8217;s full personality was shown in the 1986 World Cup against England. A deft goal from the Argentinian maestro put the English defense on edge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diego Maradona was very talented and a football magician. El He Diego, who was never afraid to break the rules to win, was the star of Argentina in 1986.Maradona has had a remarkable career in Europe with Barcelona and Napoli. The legendary playmaker had only won the Copa del Rey and Supercopa Espana with Barcelona \u200b\u200bbut put in some great performances, including a standing ovation from the hostile crowd at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. Maradona practically single-handedly led Napoli to his two Serie A titles. The Napoli maestro has seen the Argentinian maestro as his long-time savior.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3 Lionel Messi<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are among the best players of our generation. Messi was the new <strong>La Masia <\/strong>kid in 2005 and Frank, and he established himself as one of the greatest players in the game, under Frank <strong>Rijkaard <\/strong>and Pep Guardiola.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Messi became one of Barcelona&#8217;s most important figures after Ronaldinho&#8217;s departure and was the heart of Guardiola&#8217;s Barcelona team in 2008\/09.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Messi played for Argentina in the Champions League final, semi-final, and Copa del he scored a goal in the Rey final, Cl\u00e1sico at Real against Madrid. After three consecutive defeats in the final against the national team, Messi temporarily retired and returned two months later. Messi finally won the trophy in Argentina in 2021.Messi will be always in the hall of fame for the greatest players. The only player to win the <strong>Ballon d&#8217;Or <\/strong>seven times left Barcelona last summer for <strong>PSG<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Cristiano Ronaldo<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo <\/strong>was a precocious and brilliant boy at Sporting CP when Sir Alex Ferguson discovered him. At Manchester United, he cemented his legacy as one of the greatest players of our generation. Courage and commitment have made Ronaldo one of the most recognizable figures in world football. Manchester United carved him a global attraction in soccer, but Real Madrid paved his legacy. Ronaldo has stepped up at key moments, like the Champions League final and Euro 2016 semi-final.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After leaving Real Madrid for Juventus in the summer of 2018, the<strong> five-time Ballon d&#8217;Or <\/strong>winner continues to score. Last summer, Ronaldo returned to Manchester United. His hat trick against Tottenham at the age of 37 made him the all-time leading scorer (807).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Zinedine Zidane<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Zidane won the Ballon d&#8217;Or with Madrid in 1998. Zidane made his first world-class appearance in the 1998 World Cup final against Brazil.

Zinedine Zidane is one of the greatest players of all time and arguably France&#8217;s greatest. Before Ronaldo, Les Blue had Platini.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This small playmaker is known for making France a football powerhouse. As number 10, Platini gave his best in the biggest match and scored an important goal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three-time Ballon d&#8217;Or winner led France to his 1984 European Championship title.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7.

Johan Cruyff<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Johan Cruyff is one of the most influential players in <strong>football<\/strong> history. Cruyff was a pioneer who brought &#8216;total football&#8217; to Ajax, Barcelona, and the Dutch national team.

Garrincha<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Garrincha, a famous number 7 in Brazil and Bota Fogo, has won two World Cups. Garrincha captivated Brazilian audiences from 1953 to 1965 with his football talent, stunts, and streaks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garrincha made his World Cup debut for Brazil in 1958 and quickly became one of the best players in the world, scoring goals and assists for Baba and Pele.
