Gill&#8217;s century powered the Titans to another victory in the competition. However, the result also saw Virat Kohli&#8217;s Royal Challengers Bangalore exit from the tournament. While wins and losses are part of the sport, a section of fans didn&#8217;t take RCB&#8217;s loss well and abusively abused Gill on social media.

Thankfully, it&#8217;s all working out for me in the IPL business. You need to keep batting in T20 cricket.
