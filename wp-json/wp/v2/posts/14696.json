The Mukherjees, Ayhika and Sutirtha, started making those plans two decades ago as kiddies in West Bengal&#8217;s Naihati.<br>The Indian brace realised their dream of playing at the Asian Games in style at the 19th Asian Games with a citation order in women&#8217;s doubles&#8211; the country&#8217;s demoiselle tribune finish in the order at the Games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two days before losing in the semifinals, the Mukherjees had hushed a capacity crowd at the Gongshu Canal Sports Park Gymnasium by defeating China&#8217;s reigning world titleholders Chen Meng and Yidi Wang in their last- eight match to produce a massive stir in China- a country that nearly worships its TT stars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a beeline to get their studies after the palm over the world champion platoon. The same surname of two Indian girls outfoxed some of the foreign intelligencers into believing that they&#8217;re sisters.<br>&#8221; We aren&#8217;t sisters, but we partake the same surname. We&#8217;ve known each other and played together since nonage, so it&#8217;s veritably easy to understand each other,&#8221; Ayhika had said also.<br>&#8221; I can read her mind and she can read mine. And we really have fun on the table, no matter if we&#8217;re losing or are playing against the world&#8217;s stylish.&#8221;<br>The semifinal entry assured them a order. But the last- four clash against the North Koreans Cha Suyong and Pak Sugyong on Monday ended in an agonising defeat that travelled the distance in the best- of- seven match.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>(Read Also: <a href=\"https:\/\/taj777news.com\/novak-djokovic-says-future-of-tennis-looks-bright-after-emergence-of-carlos-alcaraz\/\">Novak Djokovic says future of tennis looks bright after emergence of Carlos Alcaraz<\/a>)<\/strong><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The Koreans won 7- 11, 11- 8, 7- 11, 11- 8, 11- 9, 5- 11, 11- 2 for a place in the gold- order match.<br>&#8221; They( Ayhika &amp; Sutirtha) started in the same club,&#8221; said trainer Mamta Prabhu.&#8221; Their fellowship goes back further than 20 times. They know each other really well, know the sways and outs of each other. That is why the cling is really strong.&#8221;<br>The Mukherjees did not start well, but kept throwing punches to come back, but also lost the fourth and fifth games, facing a must- palm situation in the coming game. They won it to make it 3- 3 and take the match into the decider.<br>&#8221; I suppose the North Koreans had a many points where they played really fantastic and they( Indian platoon) were completely out of meter also. Not a happy day for us, I can say.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The crowd was not as much a factor on Monday as in the quarterfinal, but the locals still backed the Koreans.<br>&#8221; We&#8217;re used to it. In the last match( quarter-final) we played against China. There were further cheers than this.
