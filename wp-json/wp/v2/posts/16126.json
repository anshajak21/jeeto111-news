He surpassed Sourav Ganguly to become the second most successful wicket-taker in the history of the International Cricket Council (ICC).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rohit Sharma achieved this after India defeated the United States of America (USA) in the 25th match of the T20 World Cup 2024. The competition between the two teams took place at the International Cricket Stadium in Nassau County in New York on Wednesday, June 12.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rohit Sharma did a great job as the captain of the team as India won the match by seven runs against the USA. It was their third win in a row in the ICC T20 World Cup 2024. They had defeated Ireland and Pakistan earlier. And with this win, they booked their place in the Super 8 of the tournament.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Most wins in ICC tournaments by an Indian captain:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>41 \u2013 MS Dhoni (58)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>17 &#8211; Rohit Sharma (20)*<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>16 \u2013 Sourav Ganguly (22)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13 \u2013 Virat Kohli (19 years)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11 &#8211; Kapil Dev (15)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11 \u2013 Mohammad Azharuddin (25)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>India was exceptional with the ball in front because they did not allow the Americans to run in at all. Arshdeep Singh was the star of the team with the ball, taking four wickets. He conceded only 9 runs. Helping the team restrict the opposition to just 110 runs at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York. With the bat, India didn&#8217;t have that kind of start as Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma (3) fell head over heels. The duo could not go at all as they returned to the warehouse in three rooms. Rishabh Pant (18) looked good as he hit some terrific shots. But he couldn&#8217;t get going when he got the start, losing to Ali Khan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, Suryakumar Yadav (50<em>) and Shivam Dube (31<\/em>) got the team out of trouble and combined to take the team home. They added an unbeaten 72 runs for the fourth wicket as the duo cruised home and booked their place in the semi-finals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is Rohit Sharma&#8217;s 17th win as captain of the Indian team in ICC Tests. The Indian captain has led the team in 20 matches and won only three matches. He passed Sourav Ganguly, who had 16 runs and is now behind MS Dhoni, who scored 41 runs in 58 runs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read Also: <a href=\"https:\/\/taj777news.com\/mohammad-rizwan-slow-fifty-sets-t20-world-cup-record\/\">Mohammad Rizwan Breaks Record for Slowest Fifty in T20 World Cup, Equals Rohit Sharma &amp; Babar Azam Feat<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Indian captain Rohit Sharma has got a big job as the captain of the Indian national cricket team.
