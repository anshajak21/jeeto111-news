They finished third in the Asia Cup, beating China 2-0 in the bronze-medal match.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming to their CWG 2022 final match against 2018 Gold Coast CWG champions New Zealand, Salima Tete (29\u2032) had scored the goal for India in the regulation time, only for Olivia Merry (60\u2032) to scored a late goal for New Zealand and push the match to a shootout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Savita had made three sensational saves in the shootout, while Sonika and Navneet Kaur struck past Kiwi goalkeeper Grace O\u2019Hanlon as India had pulled off a thrilling 2-1 shootout win after a 1-1 scoreline in regulation time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>India had began cautiously, holding the ball in the midfield. Navneet Kaur and<strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vandana_Katariya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Vandana Katariya<\/a> <\/strong>penetrated the circle in the early minutes, but New Zealand\u2019s defense cleared away the danger. Nisha made a solid save after Rose Tynan made a dangerous pass inside the circle. Salima Tete almost put her team in the lead after India forced their way into the Kiwi circle through the central channel, but her shot just went wide and the first quarter ended with both teams at 0-0. With the win, Indian women\u2019s hockey team had ended their 16-year wait for a medal in the Commonwealth games.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The year 2022 was glorious for the Indian women hockey team as they had claimed a medal in Birmingham Commonwealth Game (CWG) after a 16-year-long time wait.
