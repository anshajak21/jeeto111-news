Believe it or not, The Great Wall of China has always been in badminton and that&#8217;s why four of the top 10 players from China are in the top 10 list. China continues to dominate the badminton court with a record 161 medals up to the last World Championships, including 58 gold, 40 silver, and 63 bronze medals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Number 1: Lin Dan<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Legendary Chinese badminton player Lin Dan is number 1 and why not? He is considered by many to be the greatest male singles player of all time. At the age of 28, the smash king won all nine major titles in international badminton and completed the &#8220;Super Grand Slam&#8221;. It is very rare throughout his career that he has won a bronze medal and that is why he is &#8220;Super Dan&#8221;. His incredible achievements include two consecutive gold medals at the Olympic Games, 5 gold and one silver medal at the World Championships, 2 gold medals at the Badminton World Championship, 5 gold and 2 bronze medals at the Thomas Cup, 3 gold medals at the Asian Games, 3 Asian Games gold medals at championships and the title of the 2009 East Asian Games in Hong Kong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The list does not end here, there are many names, but at the same time, there are close names from other parts of the world that will surely one day dominate the world of badminton. Carolina Marin, Jan O Jorgensen, Viktor Axelsen, Ratchanok Intanon, Pusarla V Sindhu, Akane Yamaguchi, Saina Nehwal, Misaki Matsutomo\/ Ayaka Takahashi and Chris Adcock\/ Gabrielle Adcock are a few names to watch out for in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Number 2: Lee Chong Wei<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The second-best player is none other than Malaysian giant Lee Chong Wei. It all started on August 21, 2008, when he became the only Malaysian player to be ranked No. 1 in the world for 199 consecutive weeks. Lin Dan and Lee Chong Wei&#8217;s on-court rivalry is as famous as their off-court friendship. It was Lee who was defeated twice in the men&#8217;s singles Olympic badminton final by Lin Dan in his pursuit of the gold medal. After denying gold in 2008 and 2012, he lost the 2016 Olympic final to another Chinese player to settle for silver.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lee has been named BWF Player of the Year four times, winning gold medals at the 2006 Asian Championships, three silver and bronze medals at the World Championships, four gold medals at the Commonwealth Games, silver and three bronze medals at the Thomas Cup, and one gold and silver medal at the Southeast Asians games. <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/taj777news.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Read More<\/a><\/strong>:<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/taj777news.com\/hockey-pro-league-team-india-ready-to-begin-fresh-before-the-olympics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Hockey Pro League: Team India ready to begin fresh before the Olympics<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Number 3: Gao Ling <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Gao Ling Considered the most successful doubles player Chinese badminton player Gao Ling is the second-best player in the series.

He started very young and holds the record of winning the Indonesian Open six times. The duo, famous for their rivalry against Lin Dan, have been dubbed &#8220;arch-rivals&#8221; for the popular medals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Women&#8217;s Byte: Effects of Meditation<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In his career, he has three gold, two silver, and one bronze medals at Asian Championships, one gold, one silver, and two bronze medals at World Championships, two gold, one silver, and three bronze medals in Thomas Cup, one silver and won two bronze medals at the Asian Games and the men&#8217;s singles title at the 2004 Athens Olympics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Number 5: Rudy HartonoIn<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Fifth place is Rudy Hartono, the greatest athlete and wonderful badminton player of all time. This Indonesian former badminton player was at the peak of his career in the 1960s and 1970s when he won the world&#8217;s oldest badminton championship &#8211; the All-England Championship &#8211; eight times between 1968 and 1974, with a record seven straight wins. He played at his first BWF World Championship and won the title at the second IBF World Championship in 1980.

An amazing all-rounder who dominated the badminton court with her net game was considered the best of them all. Inducted into the International Badminton Hall of Fame in 1998, she won 3 gold medals and 2 silver medals at the 1985 BWF World Championships and also captured the World Grand Prix individual title.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Number 7: Tony Gunawan<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Another badminton player who destroyed the Great Wall of China is Tony Gunawan from Indonesia.

In the years when Asian countries dominated the badminton court, they were perhaps the only two European players who could stay on the sidelines. Morten spent twelve years in the top three positions in the world rankings. Nicknamed Mr. Badminton Morten, he won all international championships except the Badminton World Championship. Winner of all four Badminton All-England Open Championships, Morten claimed a record seven Nordic Championships. He also won the Danish Open seven times in a row. His compatriot and former world No. 1 Peter Hoeg Gade was known for his supple footwork and signature shot, the double action. The five-time European champion also won three gold medals at European team championships. He also achieved the bronze medal just before retiring at the 2012 Wuhan Thomas and Uber Cup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Number 10: Han Aiping<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Tenth on the list is Chinese badminton player Han Aiping.
