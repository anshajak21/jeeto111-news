This is 12 months after the firebrand Australian finished runner-up to Novak Djokovic.<br><br>(Read Also : <a href=\"https:\/\/taj777news.com\/indias-squad-for-bangladesh-odis-and-t20is-announced\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BCCI announces India women\u2019s squad, schedule for Bangladesh T20Is and ODIs<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick Kyrgios withdrew from Wimbledon on Sunday with a wrist injury. This stripped the tournament of one of its headline acts 12 months after the firebrand Australian finished runner-up to Novak Djokovic. &#8220;I&#8217;m really sad to say that I have to withdraw from Wimbledon this year,&#8221; the 28-year-old wrote on Instagram, explaining that he had hurt his wrist as he prepared to play in Mallorca last week. Kyrgios had been an injury doubt in the Wimbledon build-up. However, that was because he was struggling to recover from knee surgery which restricted him to just one match in 2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I tried my hardest to be ready after my surgery and step on the Wimbledon courts again. During my comeback, I experienced some wrist pain during Mallorca,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As a precaution, I had it scanned and it showed a torn ligament in my wrist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I tried everything to be able to play and I am disappointed to say that I just didn&#8217;t have enough time to manage it before Wimbledon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be back, and I appreciate your support.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kyrgios faced wild card David Goffin in the first round at the All England Club on Monday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His place in the draw will be taken by a lucky loser from qualifying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier Sunday, Kyrgios, whose lone match in 2023 came in Stuttgart last month, said his battle to regain full fitness had been &#8220;brutal&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8216;Dreading coming back&#8217;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, he added: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t miss the sport. I was almost dreading coming back a little bit, but it&#8217;s my job.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also admitted there remained &#8220;question marks&#8221; about his ability to play best-of-five sets after such a lengthy absence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I feel like to the outside world, people don&#8217;t understand. Just because it&#8217;s not contact, it&#8217;s not that physical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I dare someone to step out there and play for four hours with Novak and see how you feel afterwards.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wimbledon.com\/\">Wimbledon<\/a> in 2022, the Australian dominated most headlines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His high-octane, flamboyant shot-making was accompanied by signature clashes with rivals and officialdom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was fined $10,000 for spitting and $4,000 for shouting obscenities &#8212; one of which sent British tabloids into meltdown as it was within earshot of eight-year-old Prince George.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kyrgios also fought out an explosive third round clash with Stefanos Tsitsipas with the Greek even describing him as &#8220;evil&#8221; and a &#8220;bully&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the final against Djokovic, he demanded a woman be ejected from the crowd for consuming &#8220;700 drinks, bro&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In a way it was comforting to be home. Obviously heartbreaking as well,&#8221; said Kyrgios as he reflected on his time out of the sport.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Last year I felt like everything kind of came together for me. Finals of Wimbledon. Barely lost a match. Had the third best season on tour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Obviously my body was just crying out for some sort of rest.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Kyrgios, being away from the tennis courts didn&#8217;t mean an absence from the public view.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May, his car was stolen from his mother at gunpoint outside the family home in Canberra.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before that incident, Kyrgios pleaded guilty in February to assaulting a former girlfriend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He avoided a conviction for what the magistrate called a &#8220;single act of stupidity&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kyrgios has also been the headliner in the Netflix series &#8220;Break Point&#8221; where he spoke candidly about his mental health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He admitted he considered suicide and ended up in a psychiatric ward in 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It took me seven, eight years to be able to just open up about that,&#8221; he explained on Sunday.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nick Kyrgios withdrew from Wimbledon on Sunday with a wrist injury, stripping the tournament of one of its headline acts.
